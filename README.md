## Hi ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Aliah Iqbal, and I am a Mathematics graduate with a strong passion for coding. I have completed several courses, including the Software Engineering Bootcamp with CoGrammar and HyperionDev. As part of my training, I collaborated on group projects to develop websites using JavaScript and SQL, aimed at solving real-world problems.

### One example Iâ€™m particularly proud of is an educational game that was designed for secondary school students. The goal of the game was to help students develop a solid understanding of humanities subjects such as History and Geography in an engaging and interactive way.

### In my free time, I enjoy walking in sunny weather, watching YouTube videos, and treating myself to desserts.
